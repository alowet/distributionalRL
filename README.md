This repo contains the code for generating figures in Lowet et al. (in press). In order to run, it is also necessary to download the data from Zenodo.

## Organization

The code is formatted as Jupyter notebooks. There are __ such notebooks, each located within the relevant subfolder.

1. `neural_analysis/recording_figs.ipynb` plot neural recording data (mostly Figs. 2, 3, 4 and ED Figs. 2-4 and 6-8.
2. `behavior_analysis/
3. `behavior_analysis/
4. `ann_decoding/ann_decoding.ipynb` plots data from ANN-based decoding (ED Fig. 4f-l).
5. `neural_analysis/glm_analysis.ipynb` plots data from ED Fig. 5.
